# TalentReview

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of TalentReview is to provide tools to easily maintain 'cliff notes' 
on your team that can be shared between managers. This can help ensure that 
any leader is able to speak to the team, beyond their own line reports.

It also uses this data to help facilitate talent review meetings, as well as providing
visual prompts for promotions.

## Data

Data is stored in `.yaml` files. Information on each person is stored in 
one file per manager. In addition, there should be a `config.yaml` that helps 
to provide mappings (e.g. what are your job levels, and EoY ratings categories).

An example complete setup is stored in https://github.com/epijim/TalentReview/tree/master/inst/extdata.

## Updating

Managers should maintain their own YAML file. e.g. here is an [example one](https://github.com/epijim/TalentReview/blob/master/inst/extdata/Giacomo_Nero.yaml).
